Question Number,Question,Answer
1,Which one of the following statements about viruses is correct?,They are the facultative parasites
2,Identify the Archaebacterium,Methanobacterium
3,Identify the correctly matched pair,"Actinomycete – Lumpy jaw, Mycoplasma – sandal spike, Bacteria – crown gall, Fungi – late blight"
4,Identify the incorrect statement about the gram-positive bacteria.,Teichoic acid absent
5,The correct statement regarding Blue Green Algae is,Lack of motile structures
6,Differentiate Homoiomerous and Heteromerous lichens.,"Homoiomerous: Algae cells evenly distributed in the thallus, Heteromerous: A distinct layer of alga and fungi present"
7,Write the distinguishing features of Monera.,"1. This kingdom includes all prokaryotic organisms. Example: Mycoplasma, bacteria, actinomycetes, and cyanobacteria.
2. These are microscopic. They do not have a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
3. Many other bacteria like Rhizobium, Azotobacter, and Clostridium can fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia.
4. Some bacteria are parasites and others live as symbionts."
8,Why do farmers plant leguminous crops in crop rotations/mixed cropping?,"Rhizobium- Nitrogen-fixing bacteria living in root modules of leguminous plants has symbiotic association, fixes atmospheric nitrogen, converts to nitrates, increases soil fertility. Growing legumes alternatively with paddy helps high yield through crop rotation. Mixed cropping enriches soil by fixing atmospheric nitrogen."
9,Briefly discuss the 5 kingdom system of classification. Add a note on their merits and demerits.,"Proposed by R.H. Whittaker, based on cell structure, thallus organization, mode of nutrition, reproduction, and phylogenetic relations. Kingdoms: Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, Animalia. Merits: Based on cell complexity, organization, nutrition. Demerits: Includes both autotrophic & heterotrophic organisms in same groups."
10,Give a general account of lichens,"Definition: Symbiotic association of algae (Phycobiont) and fungi (Mycobiont). Algae provides nutrition through photosynthesis, fungi provides protection and helps in fixing to substratum. Classifications based on habitat, morphology, distribution of algae cells, and fungal partner. Economic importance includes rock weathering, pollution indication, and dye production."
